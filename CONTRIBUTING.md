Your contributions are absolutely welcome! Here are two ways you can help:

## Create a Pull Request
If you know your way around Git and Github, you can fork this repo, commit your changes, then open a pull request to have your changes reviewed and integrated directly into this repo. Here is a [good guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on how to do that.

## Open an Issue
If Git isn't your thing, that's also totally fine! Just open up a new [Issue](https://github.com/jasonwebb/morphogenesis-resources/issues) describing the changes you'd like to see. Post any relevant links, images, descriptions, potential topics, or anything else you think would be a good fit for the document. When I see your issue I'll integrate the changes myself and let you know ASAP!
